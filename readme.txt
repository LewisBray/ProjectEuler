The idea for this repository is to work through the Project Euler problems
in multiple languages.  At the moment I'm going to solve the problems in
Python and C++ with potentially other languages getting added along the way.

For C++ I'm going to aim at getting maximum performance.  If I understand
Project Euler correctly, all of the information is known at compile-time
and so in theory the answer should be able to be calculated by the compiler
during compilation and then we can just display the answer.  I'm sure there
will be exceptions to this but it strikes me as an interesting project.

In Python I'm just going to aim for something like "elegance" or
"simplicity".  I don't see much point in trying to squeeze performance out
of every language and Python has features that aren't available to me in
C++ like generator functions, etc... and I want to expose myself to these
more.

At the moment, the only other language that I would consider adding to the
repository would probably be Haskell, being purely functional I want to be
exposed to that paradigm and learn other programming concepts like monads,
currying, etc... to see if it can make me more rounded.
