The idea for this repository is to work through the Project Euler problems
in multiple languages.  I'm going to solve the problems in Python, C++ and
Haskell with no plans for any other languages at the moment.

For C++ I'm going to aim at getting maximum performance.  If I understand
Project Euler correctly, all of the information is known at compile-time
and so in theory the answer should be able to be calculated by the compiler
during compilation and then we can just display the answer.  I'm sure there
will be exceptions to this but it strikes me as an interesting project.

In Python I'm just going to aim for something like "elegance" or
"simplicity".  I don't see much point in trying to squeeze performance out
of every language and Python has features that aren't available to me in
C++ like generator functions, etc... and I want to expose myself to these
more.

For Haskell I'm mostly just interested in learning a different paradigm to
be more well-rounded and see if I can incorporate different concepts into
my general toolbox like monads, currying, etc...  I imagine I'd most
likely go for something like elegance with this language too but I'm
restricted in different ways to Python so I think it's worthwhile.
